# CIDR rules will apply to traffic where one side of the connection is:
# A network endpoint outside the cluster
# The host network namespace where the pod is running.
# Within the cluster prefix but the IPâ€™s networking is not provided by Cilium.

# This example shows how to allow all endpoints with the label app=myService
# to talk to the external IP 20.1.1.1, as well as the CIDR prefix 10.0.0.0/8,
# but not CIDR prefix 10.96.0.0/12
